The present work is focused in applying semantic web vocabularies and datasets to model 
quantitative indexes from both structural and computational points of view. Currently one 
of the mainstreams in the Semantic Web area is the Linked Data initiative which principles 
have been applied to different domains such as  e-Government, e-Health, Biomedicine, Education, Bibliography or Geography 
to name a few,  with the aim of solving existing problems of integration and interoperability 
among applications and create a proper knowledge environment under Web-based protocolos. 

In order to reach this major objective the publication of information and data under a common data model (RDF) and formats with 
a specific formal query language (SPARQL~\cite{Sparql11}) provide the required building blocks to turn the Web of documents 
into a real database of data~\cite{freebase}. As a consequence the popular diagram of the Linked Data Cloud~\cite{linked-data-cloud}, 
generated from metadata extracted from the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN~\cite{ckan}) out, 
contains $337$ datasets, with more than $25$ billion RDF triples and $395$ million links in different  domains. 
Research works are focused in two main areas: 1) production/publishing~\cite{bizer07how} and 2) consumption of  Linked Data. 
In the first case data quality~\cite{bizer2007,wiqa,ld-quality,lodq,link-qa}, conformance~\cite{HoganUHCPD:2012:237}, 
provenance~\cite{w3c-prov,DBLP:conf/ipaw/HartigZ10}, trust~\cite{Carroll05namedgraphs}, description of datasets~\cite{void,Cyganiak08semanticsitemaps,ckanValidator} and 
entity reconciliation~\cite{Serimi,Maali_Cyganiak_2011} are becoming major objectives since a mass of amount data is already available~\cite{Triplify} 
through SPARQL endpoints deployed on the top of RDF repositories such as OpenLink Virtuoso or OWLim. 

On the other hand, consumption of Linked Data is being addressed to provide new ways of data visualization~\cite{DBLP:journals/semweb/DadzieR11,hoga-etal-2011-swse-JWS}, 
faceted browsing~\cite{Pietriga06fresnel,citeulike:8529753,Sparallax} and searching~\cite{hoga-etal-2011-swse-JWS}, processing~\cite{Harth:2011:SIP:1963192.1963318} and exploitation of data applying 
different approaches such as sensors~\cite{Jeung:2010:EMM:1850003.1850235,ontology-search} and techniques  such as distributed 
queries\cite{Hartig09executingsparql,Ankolekar07thetwo,sparqlOpt}, scalable reasoning process~\cite{DBLP:conf/semweb/UrbaniKOH09,HoganHarthPolleres2009,DBLP:conf/semweb/HoganPPD10}, 
annnotation of web pages~\cite{rdfa-primer} or information retrieval~\cite{Pound} to name a few.

In the particular case of statistical data, the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary~\cite{rdf-data-cube}
a W3C Working Draft document, is a shared effort to represent statistical data in RDF reusing parts (the cube model) 
of the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange Vocabulary (SDMX)~\cite{sdmx}, an ISO standard 
for exchanging and sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations. The Data Cube vocabulary is a core 
foundation which supports extension vocabularies to enable publication of other aspects of statistical data flows or 
other multi-dimensional data sets. Previously, the Statistical Core Vocabulary~\cite{scovo} was the standard in fact to describe statistical information in the Web of Data.
Some works are also emerging to publish statistical data following the concepts of the LOD initiative 
such as~\cite{DBLP:conf/semweb/ZapilkoM11,DBLP:journals/ijsc/SalasMBCMA12,DDI2013,DBLP:conf/dgo/FernandezMG11} among others.
