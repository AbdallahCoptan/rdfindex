\begin{abstract}
The compilation of key performance indicators in just one value is 
becoming a challenging task in certain domains to summarize data and information. 
In this context, policymakers are continuously gathering and analyzing statistical 
data with the aim of providing objective measures about a specific policy, activity, 
product or service and making some kind of decision. Nevertheless existing tools 
and techniques based on traditional processes are preventing a 
proper use of the new dynamic and data environment avoiding more timely, 
adaptable and flexible (on-demand) quantitative index creation. On the other hand, 
semantic-based technologies emerge to provide the adequate building blocks 
to represent domain-knowledge and process data in a flexible fashion 
using a common and shared data model. That is why a RDF vocabulary designed on 
the top of the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary to model quantitative indexes 
is introduced in this paper. Moreover a Java and SPARQL based processor 
of this vocabulary is also presented as a tool to exploit the index meta-data structure and automatically 
perform the computation process to populate new values. Finally some discussion, 
conclusions and future work are also outlined.
