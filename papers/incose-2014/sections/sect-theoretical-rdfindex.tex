Essentially a quantitative index is comprised of the aggregation of several components. In the same way, 
a component is also composed of the aggregation of indicators that keep concrete observations. From this initial definition 
some characteristics and assumptions can be found: 1) although observations can be directly mapped to an index or a component, they 
are frequently computed applying a bottom-up approach from an indicator to a component and so on. 2) An observation is 
a real numerical value extracted from some agent out under a precise context. Generally observations only takes one measure and are considered 
to be raw without any pre-processing. 3) Before aggregating observation values, components and indexes can 
estimate missing values to finally normalize them in order to get a quantitative value. According to the aforementioned characteristics and assumptions an ``observable'' element (index, component or indicator) is a 
dataset of observations under a specific context (dimensions and/or meta-data) that can be directly gathered from external 
sources or computed by some kind of OWA operator. 

\begin{definition}[Observation-$o$]\upshape
It is a tuple $\{v,m,s\}$, where $v$ is a numerical value for the measure $m$ with an status $s$ that belongs to 
only one dataset of observations $O$. 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Dataset-$q$]\upshape
It is a tuple $\{O,m,D,A,T\}$ where $O$ is a set of observations for only one measure $m$ that is described under 
a set of dimensions $D$ and a set of annotations $A$. Additionally, some attributes can be defined in the set $T$ for structure enrichment. 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Aggregated dataset-$aq$]\upshape
It is an aggregation of $n$ datasets $q_i$ (identified by the set $Q$) which set of observations $O$ is derivate by applying 
an OWA operator $p$ to the observations $O_{q_i}$. 
\end{definition}

As a necessary condition for the computation process, an aggregated dataset $aq$ defined by means of the set of dimensions $D_{aq}$ can be computed iif 
$\forall q_j \in Q: D_{aq} \subseteq D_{q_j}$. Furthermore the OWA operator $p$ can only aggregate values belonging to the same measure $m$.

As a consequence of the aforementioned definitions some remarks must be outlined in order to restrict the understanding of 
a quantitative index (structure and computation):
\begin{itemize}
 \item The set of dimensions $D$, annotations $A$ and attributes $T$ for a given dataset $Q$ is always the same with the aim of describing all observations under 
 the same context.
 \item An index $i$ and a component $c$ are aggregated datasets. Nevertheless this restriction is relaxed if observations can be directly mapped to 
 these elements without any computation process.
 \item An indicator $in$ can be both dataset or aggregated dataset.
 \item All elements in definitions must be uniquely identified. 
 \item An aggregated dataset is also a dataset.
\end{itemize}

Following the on-going example, see Table~\ref{tab:example-wb}, the modeling of the ``The Naive World Bank Index'' would be the next one:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Each row of the table is an observation $o_i$ with a numerical value $v$, the measure is $m_{in}$ and the status is ``Raw''.
 \item Two indicators for each requirement can be found: \{ ($in_1$, ``Stability''), ($in_2$, ``Understandability'') \}, each indicator contains a set 
 of observations $O_{in_i}$. The dimensions for both indicators are: $D_{in_k}$  \{(``Project''\}. Nevertheless specific dimensions 
 could be defined for each indicator and observation if it is required. Furthermore this model also enable us the possibility of 
 merging indicators in just one aggregated indicator due to the fact that the process of calculating an aggregated indicator is 
 the same as the process to calculate components or indexes.
 
  \item In order to join requirements metrics it is necessary to aggregate requirements in just one value 
  for each indicator $in_k$. To do so the OWA operator is the average of values in each requirement. 
  
 \item In the same way, the set of components: \{($c_1$,``Maintainability''), ($c_2$,``Usability'')\} are built by aggregating the indicators $in_1$ and 
 $in_2$ using as OWA operator the ``min'' value. In this case ``min'' or ``max'' operators can be used due to an observation is uniquely identified in a 
 dataset by a tuple $\{v,m,s\} \cup D$. 
 
 \item Finally, the index is computed using the general form of an OWA operator $\sum_{i=1}^n  w_i c_i$ and taking as weights those we select. 
 

\end{itemize}

As final remark, the computation process is generating new observations, following a bottom-up approach, according to the structure defined 
in each dataset. Although a logical structure of indexes, components and indicators can be directly established using narrower/broader properties 
the main advantage of this approach lies in the possibility of expressing new elements by aggregating the existing ones. Nevertheless restrictions 
about the type of dataset that can be aggregated in each level could be added at any time for other reasons such as validation or to generate 
a human-readable form of the index.


\section{The RDFIndex vocabulary}
Since previous section has stated the key definitions to represent quantitative indexes by aggregation, a direct translation built 
on the top of the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, SDMX and other semantic web vocabularies is presented in Table~\ref{index-to-rdf}. Thus 
all concepts in the index are described reusing existing definitions, taking advantage of previous efforts and pre-established semantics 
with the aim of being extended in the future to fit new requirements. According to these mappings a definition of the index in the 
on-going example and some dimensions are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:results-rdf-index} and Figure~\ref{fig:results-rdf-properties}.

Since the structure and the computation processes can be built on the top of existing RDF vocabulary it is then 
possible to make a translation to a generic SPARQL query (includes the basic OWA operator), see Figure~\ref{fig:results-rdf-sparql-template}, 
in order generate new observations following the bottom-up approach that previous section has outlined.

\subsection{A Java-SPARQL based interpreter of the RDFIndex}
The first implementation of the RDFIndex vocabulary processor~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/chemaar/rdfindex}} is based on traditional 
language processor techniques such as the use of design patterns (e.g. Composite or Visitor) 
to separate the exploitation of meta-data from the interpretation. Thus the processor 
works and provides next functionalities (hereafter load and query an endpoint are completely equivalent due to 
data is separated from access and storage formats):

\begin{itemize}
 \item The RDFIndex ontology is loaded to have access to common definitions.
 \item The structure of an index described with the aforementioned vocabulary is 
 also loaded to create a kind of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) containing the defined meta-data.
 \item Once the meta-data structure is available in the AST it can be managed 
 through three AST walkers that performs: 1) validation (structure and RDF Data Cube normalization) 
 and 2) SPARQL queries creation and 3) documentation generation (optional). 
%  As an example a partial creation of a SPARQL implementing  the z-score normalization function is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:sparql-zscore}.
 \item In order to promote new observations to the different components and indexes 
 a set of raw observations is also loaded and a new AST walker generates new values, through SPARQL queries (see Figure~\ref{fig:sparql-generated-query}), 
 in a bottom-up approach until reaching the upper-level (index), see Table~\ref{tab:example-generated-wb} and Figure~\ref{fig:generated observation}. 
 Finally each new observation also contains a data property to store the hash MD5 of a string comprising 
 (publisher, $q$, $D$, $v$) and separated by \#, e.g. ``RDFIndex\#TheNaiveRequirementQualityIndex\#P1\#2013\#0.61'', to avoid potential ``man-in-the-middle'' attacks when the new observations 
 are published. This value are easily generated using the new string functions in SPARQL 1.1 \texttt{concat} and \texttt{MD5}.
